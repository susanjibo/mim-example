#The Multimodal Interaction Module

A simple, illustrative implementation of the MIM (Multimodal Interaction Module) concept.

MIMs are used to simplify the development of user interaction, particularly those involving dialog.

MIMs encapsulate logic that is required by all dialog interactions, such as handling input errors and retry attempts.

See the [Introduction to MIMs](https://developers.jibo.com/sdk/docs/curriculum/video-tutorials.html#an_introduction_to_mims) webinar for a detailed explanation.
